# Hello people! 

I'm a backend/full stack developer (yeah, weird mix), very interested and passionate about software design, languages and DYI.

## Some of my projects

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/table2csv"><img src="https://gh-card.dev/repos/OmbraDiFenice/table2csv.svg"></a>

This is a very simple jQuery plugin that allow to export an HTML table as csv.
You can download a csv file directly or just convert it to a string to print out in your page.
Check out the [live demo page](https://ombradifenice.github.io/table2csv/) if you want to try it out.

It's very simple, yet it was useful to me (it is actually a subproduct of a tool I wrote at work a while ago) so I thought to share it and also used it to experiment with a release on npmjs.

This is a library, usable both on Arduino and on RaspberryPi, to drive a DIY built Led cube.
This was my first attempt to work with an Arduino, and it was interesting to work on a resources constrained hardware.

This project features:
 - my own (extremely simple) C++ test framework which _can run on Arduino itself_. I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't having any "surprise" with things specific to the hardware (e.g. bit ordering in memory)
 - some simple utility classes (string and vector), again because I didn't have them available from C++ std lib on Arduino
 - dynamically extensible set of effects that can be played on the cube. Adding a new one is just a matter of creating a new file with the code and calling the dedicated macro to register it in the system
